AI DRIVEN EXPLORATION AND PREDICTION OF COMPANY REGISTRATION
TRENDS WITH REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES (RoC)
This project report outlines the development and implementation of an AI-
driven system for the exploration and prediction of company registration
trends using data from the Register of Companies. The primary objective of
this project is to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning
techniques to analyze historical company registration data, identify patterns
and trends, and make predictive forecasts to assist government authorities,
business analysts, and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding
economic development and regulatory changes.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Register of Companies (RoC) maintains a database of company
registrations and related information. Analyzing this data can provide valuable
insights into economic trends, industrial growth, and regulatory compliance.
This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that can automatically
process, analyze, and predict company registration trends based on historical
RoC data.
2. PROJECT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
SCOPE:
• Collect historical company registration data from RoC.
• Preprocess and clean the data for analysis.
• Explore the data to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
• Develop AI and machine learning models for trend analysis and
prediction.
• Create a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to access the insights.
OBJECTIVES:
• Build a data pipeline for regular data updates.
• Develop predictive models for company registration trends.
• Provide interactive visualizations to convey insights.
• Evaluate model performance and validate predic
